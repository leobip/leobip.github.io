## Local Development Environment Setup Guide

### Introduction

Setting up a well-structured local development environment is crucial for improving code quality, automating testing, and streamlining deployment. In this guide, we will progressively build a local development ecosystem, adding essential tools step by step. Our goal is to create an environment that helps in writing, analyzing, testing, and deploying code efficiently.

### Planned Sections (For Start):

- **Code Analysis (SonarQube)** â€“ Static code analysis to ensure quality.
- **Version Control (GitHub)** â€“ Managing and tracking code changes.
- **Linting (SonarLint for VS Code)** â€“ Ensuring code consistency in the IDE.

## Creation of the Structure

To begin setting up the local development environment, letâ€™s start by creating the folder structure for the project and defining where each tool and configuration will reside. Hereâ€™s a suggested structure:

```bash
local-dev-environment/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ sonarqube/                  # SonarQube setup and configuration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ conf/                   # SonarQube configuration files (sonar.properties, etc.)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ data/                   # Data storage for SonarQube (database, etc.)
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                      # Test files for local development
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test_example.py         # Example unit test
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                   # Project documentation
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt            # Dependencies for environment (if needed)
...
... (in development)

```

#### Steps:

* Create the folders and initialize the repository
* You can initialize the repository by running git init in the root folder of local-dev-environment.
* Push the code to your GitHub repository and link it here: [Project GitHub Repository](https://github.com/your-repository-link)

This guide will start with SonarQube, a powerful tool for static code analysis, and expand as we integrate more tools.
